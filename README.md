# Crest Trade Finder v1.0.3.1
Implements the EVE Crest API to find the best trades between the major trade hubs.
Select which of the 5 trade hubs you are docked in:
* Amarr
* Dodixie
* Rens
* Hek
* Jita

It will return a lazyloaded table of trades you can make at other trade hubs. Allows table sorting on any of the fields to see what items are selling at your hub for a low price and can be sold at another hub for a higher price.
