# Crest Trade Finder v1.1.0

## About

Implements the EVE Crest API to find the best trades between the major trade hubs.
Select which of the 5 trade hubs you are docked in:
* Amarr
* Dodixie
* Rens
* Hek
* Jita

It will return a lazyloaded table of trades you can make at other trade hubs. Allows table sorting on any of the fields to see what items are selling at your hub for a low price and can be sold at another hub for a higher price.

## Release Notes

* Minified CSS and Javascript to improve performance
* Addition of multiple orders (up to top 3 for an item)
* Buy/Sell quantity columns added with highlighted recommendation
* Highlighting capabilities improved. Highlight one or multiple.
* Right-click to update the item.
* Updated UI to include start location, and end location(s) to reduce calls to hubs you are not intending to go
* Updated UI to better fit on smaller screens
