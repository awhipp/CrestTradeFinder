# Crest Trade Finder v1.1.1

## About

Implements the EVE Crest API to find the best trades between the major trade hubs.
Select which of the 5 trade hubs you are docked in:
* Amarr
* Dodixie
* Rens
* Hek
* Jita

It will return a lazyloaded table of trades you can make at other trade hubs. Allows table sorting on any of the fields to see what items are selling at your hub for a low price and can be sold at another hub for a higher price.

## Bug Fix v1.1.1

* Update no longer returns just the top trade for all 3 slots
* Update graphic now just changes opacity. Less intrusive.
* Update now removes any lingering updates if not updated in 25 seconds.
* Algorithm was not always returning the most profitable runs  if runs > 3
* CTRL or SHIFT available to select all of an item type
