## About

Implements the EVE ESI API to find:

    * the best margins inside your own station.
    * the best trades between stations.
    * the best trades between systems.
    * the best trades between regions.

Select which of the station you are docked in. It will return a lazy-loaded table of trades you can make at other station. Allows table sorting on any of the fields to see what items are selling at your hub for a low price and can be sold at another hub for a higher price.
