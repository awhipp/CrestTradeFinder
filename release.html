<title>EVE Trade Release Notes v3.0.1</title>

<xmp theme="cyborg" style="display:none;">
## About
Implements the EVE Crest API to find:

* the best trades between the major trade hubs.
* the best margins inside your own station

Select which of the 5 trade hubs you are docked in:

* Amarr
* Dodixie
* Rens
* Hek
* Jita

It will return a lazy-loaded table of trades you can make at other trade hubs. Allows table sorting on any of the fields to see what items are selling at your hub for a low price and can be sold at another hub for a higher price.

### V3.0.1 Improved Performance and Setup
* Modified requests to abide by rate limit
* Improved return performance.
* Simplified request calls to enable future development of cross region trading
* Progress Bar

### V3.0.0b Custom Trading Routes
* Due to popular demand we have now implemented a 1-to-1 trading drop down for finding the best deals between two stations
* Also added custom select station trading
* These features is in BETA as the EVE CREST API does not currently support getting all these stations so we are working off of a fixed backend, please report any bugs you find

### V2.15 Implemented Profit filtering
* Ability to filter profits to show only rows where ISK is greater than N on route trades
